## Sending network connections to CyberSift via a Windows Agent


- Network Data collected directly from Windows Hosts

This is the easiest option to get started. You can download an install the CyberSift windows agent from here:

https://csinstallscripts.blob.core.windows.net/install-scripts/Install_CS_Agent.exe

This will install an agent which sends back logs regarding connections the Windows PC makes back to CyberSiftâ€™s ElasticSearch. The installer should guide you through setup, asking you for the CyberSift server's IP address and the port number. 

Just remember that the default ElasticSearch port is **9200** (Azure users recall that this port is not open by default on your resource group firewall). 

-------------------

 **Make sure the port 9200 is not publicly open.**
