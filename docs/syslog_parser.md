## Sending plugin-supported firewall syslog to CyberSift


A full template for importing syslogs generated by the following firewalls into CyberSift is provided in the link below:

* Palo Alto
* Sonicwall
* Mikrotik
* Pfsense

(*Cisco users please note: depending on firmware versions your syslog output might not match the expected format. As an alternative, you are able to use a custom grok filter to import data [as documented here](https://gettingstarted.cybersift.io/docs/other_syslog.md)*)
* Cisco ASA 
* Cisco Router 

(*please note that CyberSift expects to find certain fields present in the documents provided to ElasticSearch [as documented here](https://gettingstarted.cybersift.io/docs/ip_required_fields.md), the template provided below takes this into consideration*):

* [Template Link](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CyberSift/Onboarding/master/docs/templates/Palo_Alto_To_ES.xml) (right-click to "Save As")

Once imported into NiFI, the template will look similar to the following layout:

![NIFI_PALOALTO](https://github.com/CyberSift/Onboarding/blob/master/public/img/docs/nifi_paloalto.png?raw=true)

The template is originally set to accept PaloAlto traffic, changing the firewall model to match the appropriate one for your infrastructure is simple. Simply double click on the "SyslogParser" module:

![ParseSyslog](https://github.com/CyberSift/Onboarding/blob/master/public/img/docs/ParseSyslog.png?raw=true)

Click on the "Properties" tab and for the **Parser** setting, select your firewall model from the drop-down menu:
